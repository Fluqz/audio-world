Make fixed amount of global oscillators that are used. also gloabal nodes for everything
Use them when needed




Idea

There are so many objects that its imposible to have a melody playing, 
but what if there are a few special objects carrying the main tones, 
and all others are making a haromics backround.

What are the harmonics intervals? They should all fit to the key note. Or does it even matter? maybe you could take random frequencyies?
What are the harmonics volume intervals? How loud?
