TODO 

ChunkSystem
    - Chunk maps
    - Load from a file per chunk or chunk after load?
Heightmap Ground
Multiplayer
    - Socketio multiplayer 
Max4Live / AudioSystem?
    - Think about a audio system for this game. How can things be wired? Modular Synth like?
ScriptComponents
Use octree inside ecs?
Editor
    - Editor to build scenes
Game Idea? Whats the actual fun? Only the experience of walking through it and building scenes?





test

Make fixed amount of global oscillators that are used. also gloabal nodes for everything
Use them when needed




Idea

There are so many objects that its imposible to have a melody playing, 
but what if there are a few special objects carrying the main tones, 
and all others are making a haromics backround.

What are the harmonics intervals? They should all fit to the key note. Or does it even matter? maybe you could take random frequencyies?
What are the harmonics volume intervals? How loud?


Map generation

Use noise generation to define a map.
How to make smaller areas coherent?
Define an area as a group which works together.
Basicly an area works as one random tangled (modular) synthesizer
and close areas can be heard simultaniousely.
An area always needs to have a
- A melody playing
- background carpet/ harmonics
- some drums
- random effects
- random samples/clips

there are also objects, that arent considered belonging to a group.
Static objects like, stones
 - these are very subtle and barely bring any hype to the whole sound
Moving objects like butterflies or animals
 - These are very alive and can affect sound massively

Objects in general can have multiple sound sources at the same time!
Actual synthesized sounds and environmental clips
